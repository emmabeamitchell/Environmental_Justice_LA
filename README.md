# Analyzing Bird Diversity Across Historically Redlined Districts in LA County
## Author: Emma Bea Mitchell 

## Description
This project analyzes and maps the historically redlined districts in LA County, and examines bird diversity by grade. It was created for a Geospatial and Remote Sensing graduate course, which focuses heavily on maps and figures to display findings. In this repository we:
- filter down geometric data
- join geometric data sets
- plot redlined district grades, bird diversity, and social data
- use our plots to analyze the lasting effects of redlining on biodiversity and people

## Skills used in this repository

- transforming CRSs of data
- joining geometric data sets
- wrangling geometric data
- using ggplot to create detailed plots
- using tmap to create detailed maps
